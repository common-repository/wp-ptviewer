A plugin for wordpress which allows you to easily insert dynamic panoramic pictures inside your posts using the java applet ptviewer.

== Description ==

This plugin will allow you to easily insert panoramic pictures inside your posts using one of the best free java viewers available: PTViewer. Just insert a quicktag specifying the image and information about the panorama (field of view, image size, horizon position) and the plugin will compute the corresponding obscure applet parameters (in particular for partial panoramas covering less than 360 degrees of field of view).

All the instructions for installation, the support forums, a FAQ, etc. can be found on the [plugin home page](http://www.marvinlabs.com/products-and-references/wordpress-addons/wp-ptviewer/).
